# Workshop Maikel

I followed along Maikel's workshop of creating a flipboard video app.

Built without a framework, I thought it was interesting seeing a vanilla approach, while I am so used to frameworks.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jarvin-s/flipboard-video
   cd flipboard-video
   ```

### 2. Start a live server
Make sure you have the [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) (VS Code) installed

On bottom right of your screen, press "Go Live"

### 3. Give your browser permission to use your camera

Your app will be available at:
http://127.0.0.1:5500 (port may vary)
